# Documentation Standards

All AIND repositories should have an associated README that describes their purpose and provides some minimal instructions for installing and using the repo.  

This README should be created in the initial commit for a repository to avoid the possibility that repos are created without this documentation. READMEs can and should be amended and filled out as a codebase matures, but the basic purpose and minimal setup/use instructions should be written down from the start. This is important as it allows internal and external users of AIND resources to understand the purpose of repositories as they browse the AIND github page.  

Note that more extensive documentation beyond a README is encouraged, but does not replace the need for a basic README. For example, automated documentation can be created using tools like [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/) or [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), resulting in extensive documentation of modules, functions, etc. at a unique URL (e.g. `docs.REPO_NAME.dev`). This more extensive documentation page should be linked directly from the README. See

# Categories of Repositories

Different categories of repositories have different documentation requirements. Each repo category below links to the associated page detailing the documentation standards for each.

* Data acquisition: A repo containing code that controls acquisition of data. This is the code running on the computers controlling some experimental platform. Examples include fiber photometry acquisition or various behavioral tasks. LINK TO STANDARD

* Data analysis: A repo containing code intended for analysis of acquired data. This might belong to a single scientist or be a shared resource intended for use by multiple scientists (internal and/or external). NO STANDARD YET DEFINED

* Code Ocean capsules: A repo connected to a Code Ocean capsule. This includes one-off capsules used for analysis/exploration and capsules that are part of one or more analysis pipelines. LINK TO STANDARD

* Code Ocean pipelines: A repo connected to a Code Ocean pipeline. LINK TO STANDARD
