# AIND File Standards

This repository contains the file standards for the Allen Institute for Neural Dynamics (AIND).

## Goal

The overarching goal of this effort is to give users, developers, and any system that produces or consumes information within AIND a clear set of specifications for structuring acquired data. This will make it easier to validate acquisition pipelines, ensure a more consistent user experience, and equip everyone with a common set of tools for working with that data.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! These will likely fall into one of the following categories:

- **New Proposals**: If you have a new file format that you would like to add, please create a new markdown file in the `file_formats` directory and follow the existing format.
- **Improvements to Existing Formats**: If you have suggestions for improving existing file formats, please submit a pull request with your changes.
